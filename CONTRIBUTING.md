## Pull Requests

Use the general [feature branch
workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
for development. After a feature is complete, make a pull request and wait for 1
approval before merging.

Try to keep PRs as small and focused as possible.
